# LLM-Based Test Case Generation with Mutation Testing

This project uses a Large Language Model (LLM) called **Gemini** to automatically generate test cases for Python code. It also uses a technique called **mutation testing** to check how good the tests are.

We also use a method called **MuTAP** to improve the tests and compare everything with tests made by a tool called **Pynguin**.

## What This Project Does

- Automatically creates test cases using Gemini (zero-shot and few-shot prompts).
- Uses **mutation testing** to measure test quality.
- Improves tests with **MuTAP**, which helps fix weak tests.
- Compares results with the **Pynguin** test generation tool.
